        <h5><u>SmartyCats Tutoring, 01/2019 to Current</u></h5>
        <p>As a tutor I have developed student confidence through attentive instruction in Computer Science and Spanish. Besides the teaching I have also participated in multiple training classes to improve my tutoring practices and learn new teaching techniques.</p>
        <h5><u>C&C Logging, 11/2014 to 08/2019</u></h5>
        <p>While working for C&C logging I operated many heavy machines including processors, shovels, skidders and loaders on a regular basis. I was required to perform routine mechanical maintenance as well as repair broken parts. Additionally, maximizing safety by avoiding hazards and critically thinking was critical.</p>
        <h5><u>Ponsse, 06/2016 to 07/2016</u></h5>
        <p>At Ponsseâ€™s headquarters in Finland I took part in a six week long internship program. During this program I worked among many industry leading technicians and helped them repair various computer hardware. I installed RAM, replaced harddrives and installed new operating systems on many computers. During the internship I was able to experience much of the Finnish culture while also learning valuable computer hardware repair skills such as troubleshooting and soldering.</p>
